# visua 2 :
![alt text](media/visua2-sketch.png)
This was the sketch for visualization 2, we opted for a different approach where you can hover on different departments to see the largest used name in that department, the number of times it was used and the same for the least used name.

This version is the one we decided on for this first delivrable
### strengths :
- Allows for quickly identifying the most popular name per department.

- Makes it easy to spot departments that have high number of top names.

### Weakneses :
- Doesn’t provide information about the distribution of other names within each department (e.g., how dominant the top name is compared to the others).

- Lacks temporal context — there’s no way to explore how name usage changes over time, as the visualization only shows a static snapshot.
